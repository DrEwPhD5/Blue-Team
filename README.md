# Blue-Team
This presentation and follow-up questions were the result of simulating defensive security monitoring through Splunk for the University of Texas at Austin's cybersecurity certification program. 
Using a set of provided logs, our team was able to set monitor data to create reports and set alerts in a SIEM environment and then assess the efectiveness of those alerts and reports in a simulated cybersecurity incident.
